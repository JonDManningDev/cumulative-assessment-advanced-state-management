# Cumulative Assessment: Advanced State Management

*This repo is my solution for the Qualified assessment for 5.9.6.*

*Modify an existing React application so that it utilizes the Context API for state props that are consumed by multiple components, rather than by prop drilling. Use multiple contexts and providers, overlapping when components may use data provided by multiple contexts at once.*
